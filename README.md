# ForC


Task #2
1. Write a function that ﬁnds the biggest element in an array of ints.
2. Create a linked list library with functions list_add(), list_contains(), list_remove(). Elements in a list should be dynamically allocated. 
3. Create an integer array library with functions ar_push(), ar_ﬁnd_ﬁrst(), ar_remove(). Array should be allocated dynamically. 
	The ar_push() function adds a new element after the last one; ar_ﬁnd_ﬁrst() returns the positive index of the ﬁrst occurrence 
	of the given element in the array or -1 if the number is not in the array; ar_remove() removes the element by it's index. 
	Order of elements in an array is not important.

Task #1
1. Write the swap16, swap32, swap64 functions that swap bytes in uint16_t, uint32_t, and uint64_t (endianness conversions).
2. Write a function that converts the RGB888 data format to RGB565.
3. Write a program that gets two values from a user: height and width of a rectangle in meters and calculates and prints the perimeter and the area of the rectangle in inches.
4. Write a program that computes the perimeter and the area of a circle with a radius of 6.
5. Write a program that computes the factorial of 10 Write a program that prints all the integer numbers between 1 to 500 which are divisible by a number received from a user.
